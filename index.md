## Welcome to Jin Soo Park's Pages

I am a MS/Ph.D. Student of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Texas at Austin. I'm fortunate to be the member of the Learning Agents Research Group(LARG) advised by [Prof. Peter Stone](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/). My research focuses on the Reinforcement Learning, multi agent system and computer vision.
